# Starwars_LDR_Arduino
A program that detects whether there's some amount of light and starts playing a song with a buzzer

This program will run on Arduino. It detects the amount of light using a LDR sensor. 
Most of its parts can be changed as preferred. You can change the luminosity factor, or even the song the buzzer will play. The way it is, it may start playing when you turn on a cell phone camera's flash or a laser pointer to it
The song played is a version of the Imperial March from the Star Wars series. I don't intend to have any profits with the program and I am just using it for knowledge purposes. All rights reserved to the song's owners.

You can use and adapt this code as you wish, freely!

If you find some variables with weird names, mind that I wrote the code as a portuguese speaker, so there could be some words I forgot to translate to English.
